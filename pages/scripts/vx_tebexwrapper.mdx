# Tebex Wrapper
This is an in-game store where players can purchase products with coins. Players can buy coins through Tebex, and these coins are automatically added to their account. These coins can then be used to purchase in-game items.


## Installation
This assumes you already have a tebex store online, if not you can create one and if you need help make sure to ask us!

1. Download the latest release of vx_lib [here](https://github.com/Vertex-Scripts/vx_lib) and add it to your server.
2. Download the latest version of our tebex wrapper from [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/assets?search=cfx_tebexwrapper) and add it to your server.
3. Setup the config, the only things that is required is: `Config.tebexSecret` and `Config.packages`.
4. Create a package, scroll all the way down and click on "Game Server Commands" and add `vx_tebexwrapper:processPayment {transaction}`.
5. Start vx_lib and vx_tebexwrapper in your server.cfg and you're good to go!

## Adding new categories
All the products are organized in categories in the data folder. You need to create a new file for each category, for example `data/items.lua` and add the following:
```lua
return {
	{
		name = "phone",
		label = "Phone",
		description = "Iphone 13+",
		price = 1,
		image = "iphone.jpg",
		metadata = {
			item = "phone",
		}
	},
  -- ... more products
}
```

Then you need to register this category in `data/categories.lua` and add the following:
```lua {2,13-19}
local carProducts = require "data.cars"
local itemProducts = require "data.items"

---@type Category[]
return {
	{
		label = "ðŸš— Cars",
		name = "Cars",
		description = "...",
		type = "vehicle",
		products = carProducts,
	},
	{
		label = "ðŸ’¼ Items",
		name = "Items",
		description = "...",
		type = "item",
		products = itemProducts,
	},
}
```

## Adding product handlers
We have already implemented some basic products such as: `money`, `item`, `vehicle`, `weapon` and more, but you can also create your own!
We created a handler system, so for each product type you can create a handler which will handle the purchase of the product.

To create a handler you need to go to `customize/handlers.lua`, and add a new handler. For example:
```lua
registerProductHandler("item", function(source, product)
	local item = product.metadata.item
	local count = product.metadata.count or 1

	vx.inventory.addItem(source, item, count)
end)
```

## Migrating from V1

### Config
This step is pretty straight forward, you can just copy the `data` folder and configure the config.

### Database
1. Remove the `vx_tebexwrapper_transactions` or `vx_tebexwrapper_transactions` table. (it wasn't used anyway)
2. Rename the `cfx_tebexwrapper_coins` to `vx_tebexwrapper_coins`.

For very old versions, the length of the identifier column was `46` now it's `128`. You can just change the length of the column in the database.
